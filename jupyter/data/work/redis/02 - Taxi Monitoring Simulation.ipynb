    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a real-time taxi monitoring system using Redis as the backend database. We'll simulate the operation of thousands of taxis in New York City by processing actual trip data from January 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation models taxi dispatching, pickup, and drop-off events to create a realistic representation of urban mobility patterns. Through this project, we'll explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: Loading and transforming NYC yellow taxi trip data\n",
    "2. **Event-Based Architecture**: Using Redis to track taxi statuses and locations in real-time\n",
    "3. **Driver Assignment**: Implementing algorithms to match available drivers with pickup requests\n",
    "4. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluating system throughput and identifying peak demand periods\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showcases practical applications of Redis data structures (sorted sets, hashes) for tracking real-time events in a high-volume transportation system. The techniques demonstrated here can be adapted for other real-time tracking applications such as food delivery, logistics, or ride-sharing services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by setting up our environment and exploring the dataset."

    "\n",
    "The dataset `yellow_tripdata_2025-01.parquet` contains detailed information about yellow taxi trips in New York City for the month of January 2025. This dataset is part of the larger collection of yellow taxi trip records maintained by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which provides valuable insights into the city's transportation patterns.\n",

    "### Dataset Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes various attributes for each taxi trip, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pickup_datetime**: The date and time when the passenger was picked up.\n",
    "- **dropoff_datetime**: The date and time when the passenger was dropped off.\n",
    "- **pickup_location_id**: A unique identifier for the location where the trip began.\n",
    "- **dropoff_location_id**: A unique identifier for the location where the trip ended.\n",
    "- **passenger_count**: The number of passengers in the taxi during the trip.\n",
    "- **trip_distance**: The total distance of the trip in miles.\n",
    "- **fare_amount**: The fare charged for the trip.\n",
    "- **tip_amount**: The amount of tip given by the passenger.\n",
    "- **total_amount**: The total amount charged for the trip, including fare, tip, and any additional fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is instrumental for various analyses, including understanding traffic patterns, evaluating taxi service efficiency, and studying the economic aspects of taxi operations in New York City. By leveraging this data, researchers, policymakers, and businesses can gain insights into urban mobility and make informed decisions to enhance transportation services.\n",

    "## Rules of the Taxi Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "This system simulates the management of taxis in New York using Redis to keep track of drivers and their locations. Each ride record can be viewed as two events: a departure and an arrival. Below are the main rules and logic implemented in the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Departure and Arrival Events**:\n",
    "   - Each record represents a departure event (when a passenger requests a taxi) and an arrival event (when the taxi arrives at the destination).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Managing Departures**:\n",
    "   - When a passenger requests a taxi, the system looks for an available driver in the pickup location. If no driver is found in the area, a new one is created, assuming they were already present in that location to allow the departure event to occur.\n",
    "   - Once the driver is selected, they begin heading towards the arrival zone. The time required for the trip is not specified, but the arrival event is recorded in an intermediate structure that keeps track of drivers in transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Managing Arrival Events**:\n",
    "   - When a record is processed, the system also handles all arrival events that occur before the departure event. This ensures that the system remains updated and that drivers who have already arrived at destinations are correctly recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assumption of Permanence**:\n",
    "   - It is assumed that a driver remains at the arrival location after completing a trip. This means that once they arrive at the destination, the driver is considered available for new requests in the new location.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Recording Arrivals**:\n",
    "   - When a driver arrives at a specific location, they are registered in the system. This allows for tracking available drivers based on their current location.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Assigning Drivers**:\n",
    "   - If a passenger requests a taxi and an available driver is found, that driver is removed from the list of available drivers and assigned to the ride."
